            <h3>Principle</h3>
            <p>Our curriculum emphasizes on activity-based learning for which
                we create a suitable environment and focus on learning needs of
                each child rather than a predetermined set of pattern.</p>
            <h3>Determine the activities of students</h3>
            <p>We impact education by integrating an proven and effective
                method of teaching with modern technology. For example best
                on screen times are provided to understand the science concepts
                to students.</p>
            <h3>Teaching methods</h3>
            <p>A combination of projects, real life exposure, audio-visual
                presentations, classroom teaching, experiential learning,
                community visits and brainstorming activities are used to make
                learning fun, exciting and interesting. Above photos can be
                considered to realise all these points.</p>
            <h3>Healthy Environment</h3>
            <p>A child at Sunrise is always competing but not with others,
                rather this competition is with self. We always emphasize at
                learning right than learning fast. We do not let a child succumb
                to competition & rat race pressures, but we understand &
                respect that every child has his own optimal pace to learn. This
                results in a stress free environment where a child gets full
                freedom to grow individually and that might be the reason why
                every student of Sunrise love to come to school.</p>
