                <h3>Principle</h3>
                <p>Our curriculum emphasizes on activity-based learning for which
                    we create a suitable environment and focus on learning needs of
                    each child rather than a predetermined set of pattern.</p>
                <h3>Determine the activities of students</h3>
                <p>We impact education by integrating an proven and effective
                    method of teaching with modern technology. For example best
                    on screen times are provided to understand the science concepts
                    to students.</p>
                <h3>Teaching methods</h3>
                <p>A combination of projects, real life exposure, audio-visual
                    presentations, classroom teaching, experiential learning,
                    community visits and brainstorming activities are used to make
                    learning fun, exciting and interesting. Above photos can be
                    considered to realise all these points.</p>
                <h3>Healthy Environment</h3>
                <p>A child at Sunrise is always competing but not with others,
                    rather this competition is with self. We always emphasize at
                    learning right than learning fast. We do not let a child succumb
                    to competition & rat race pressures, but we understand &
                    respect that every child has his own optimal pace to learn. This
                    results in a stress free environment where a child gets full
                    freedom to grow individually and that might be the reason why
                    every student of Sunrise love to come to school.</p>
