                    Er. Vinod Chandrashekhar Suradkar (president) and
                    Er. Shreya Vinod Suradkar (Principal), setting up the school
                    not because the profit is a motive but the passion is..!!</p>
                    
                <p>One year before we had been nurturing a dream about
                    conducting a school where kids could just be the kids and their individual talent and creativity is
                    nurtured in their own pace and way. No boundaries for learning and trying new ideas, kids breathe in free and energised environment.</p>
                    
                <p>This is the school of 21st
                    century where every child is inspired to learn not because they have to but
                    because they love to.. And proudly I can say my team helped us to accomplish this goal.. Teachers of
                    sunrise grow “love”, “hope”, “joy” and “learning” among the children. Our
                    mentoring staff cares for the children in every possible way. Comparatively
                    specious classrooms but limited strength enables our mentors to give
                    enhanced attention to each student.</p>
