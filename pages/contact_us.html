                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Ans: If oneâ€™s point of view is only towards syllabus and study completion then it
                        may not be needed that much but for pre primary student , the attachment
                        with school ambience and their teachers is equally important. Consequently
                        though it is not strictly necessary to take online education for pre kids , but still
                        it can help student for their improvements in studies. And it is just an initial part
                        of the academic year 2020-21. further when the effect of corona pandemic will
                        reduce & the school will start then ultimately it will help to conduct the
                        curriculum smoothly.</p>
